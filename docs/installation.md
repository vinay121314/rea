# Installation and setup

REA separates installing its CLI from configuring external software and agents.

## Start setup

Start setup with:

```bash
npx rea-agents setup
```

If npm asks to download and run REA, that approval applies only to downloading
the package. REA shows its own plan and asks before changing agent configuration
or installing Hopper.

The short command can use a REA version installed in the current project. To
request the latest release explicitly, use:

```bash
npx rea-agents@latest setup
```

REA runs the version npm selects. To update older agent registrations, run the
latest-version command and review its setup plan. For unattended package
downloads, add `--yes` before the package name; this does not approve REA's
setup changes.

For an intentional rollback, make the package request explicit:

```bash
npm exec --yes --package=rea-agents@2.4.0 -- rea setup
```

Setup continues to pin persistent MCP registrations to the exact version that
performed setup. Running current setup later migrates unversioned or older
managed registrations through the normal reviewed setup transaction.

REA supports Node.js 22.x (>=22.19), 24.x (>=24.11), and 26+. Node.js 23, 25, and prereleases are unsupported. It uses the npm already paired with that runtime and never upgrades Node.js, npm, or Homebrew.

Running `npm install rea-agents` without `--global` installs the executable only
in the current project's `node_modules/.bin`; it does not make `rea` available
on the shell `PATH`. Use the setup command above for the guided setup
journey, `npx -y rea-agents@latest` for unattended one-off commands, or install globally
with `npm install --global rea-agents` for a shell-visible `rea` command.

The optional curl wrapper installs only the global npm package:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morluto/rea/main/install.sh | bash
```

It prints the version, runtime, npm command, and destination before installing. When a controlling terminal exists it starts `rea setup`; otherwise it prints the command to run later.

Pass options with `bash -s --`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/morluto/rea/main/install.sh |
  bash -s -- --dry-run
```

Supported options are `--version <semver>`, `--dry-run`, `--no-setup`, `--no-prompt`, and `--verbose`. Neither `--no-prompt` nor a non-interactive shell grants permission to install external dependencies.

## Supported agents

Setup can configure these clients for REA's local MCP server:

| Client             | `--client` value |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Claude Code        | `claude_code`    |
| Claude Desktop     | `claude_desktop` |
| Codex              | `codex`          |
| Cursor             | `cursor`         |
| Gemini CLI         | `gemini_cli`     |
| Windsurf           | `windsurf`       |
| Devin              | `devin`          |
| OpenCode           | `opencode`       |
| Antigravity        | `antigravity`    |
| GitHub Copilot CLI | `copilot_cli`    |
| Command Code       | `commandcode`    |
| VS Code            | `vscode`         |

## Review setup changes

`rea setup` first offers the supported agents in a multi-select. Existing REA
registrations are selected by default. Newly detected clients remain available
but unselected: detection gives setup context, not permission to add a new
registration. Clients without a detected configuration can still be selected.
Explicit `--client` flags skip this question.

Setup adds MCP access for selected clients. It installs REA's bundled workflow
with those integrations by default; use `--skill=false` to omit it. If no agent
is selected, setup offers the workflow separately for CLI use, with No as the
default. Hopper is a separate optional choice: setup shows its proposed
installation or connection and requires its own explicit approval. It can also
save verified paths for an existing Ghidra installation.

After selection, review the plan's exact paths and changes and approve before
REA writes files or installs Hopper. You can cancel at any prompt.

Before applying changes, REA checks your current configuration. The plan lists:

- an existing Hopper installation, a verified existing Ghidra installation, or the official Hopper package it proposes to install;
- each detected agent configuration path;
- the REA skill destination;
- external software, network origins, integrity evidence, and package-manager
  commands.

Malformed or unsafe existing configuration blocks the whole transaction before
Hopper installation or any file write. Declining or pressing Ctrl-C makes no
changes. Agent configuration writes preserve unrelated
entries, create backups, use atomic replacement, and verify their result.

After setup, REA reports which agents, analysis tools, and workflow files passed
its final checks. Restart any agent named in the completion message, then begin
your investigation. Failed steps and diagnostics remain in terminal history.

Select exact clients in scripts with repeatable `--client` flags. Each explicit
client skips interactive selection. Use `--all-detected` only when you intend
to configure every detected supported client. `--skill=false` omits the
workflow, and `--dry-run` returns a read-only plan with status `planned` and
exit code 0:

```bash
rea setup --client codex --client cursor --skill=false --dry-run
```

Prompt UI and progress are written to stderr so stdout remains available for
structured results and pipelines. `NO_COLOR=1` disables color. Use
`--accessible` for sequential, vertically rendered yes/no prompts. Implicit
interactive setup requires stdin, stdout, and stderr to all be terminals; when
any stream is redirected, setup stays non-interactive. Declining or cancelling
returns status `cancelled` with exit code 0.

For automation, `rea setup --json` reports the plan and a compact `.doctor`
readiness projection without applying it. Use `rea doctor --json` for full
health diagnostics and canonical tool catalog details. Pair
`--yes` with explicit scope such as `--client codex`, or use
`--all-detected` when the broad scope is intended. Without a scope flag,
`--yes` is limited to existing REA-owned registrations; it does not select all
detected clients. An unapproved actual apply reports `needs_confirmation` and
exits 1. Installing missing Hopper non-interactively additionally requires
`--install-hopper`:

```bash
rea setup --yes --all-detected --install-hopper --json
```

Setup pins package-runner MCP registrations to the exact installed REA version,
installs the matching skill and on-demand references in the same plan, and adds
`startup_timeout_sec = 30` for Codex. `rea update` installs the exact resolved
release into the npm prefix that owns the running package, then checks the new
executable's version before reporting success. It does not reopen onboarding.
Release lookup and installation both use npm's configured registry.
Its maintenance plan selects only existing REA registrations and an already
installed REA skill. Run the returned scoped setup command to review and approve
those changes, then restart affected agents. The plan is returned in terminal,
non-TTY, and JSON modes without applying configuration changes.

## Hopper

Hopper is separate commercial software with its own license. Its free demo has
vendor-defined limits, and a paid license is optional. REA reuses any detected
installation and preserves Hopper during uninstall.

On macOS, approved setup downloads the official DMG, checks its published size
and digest, validates the application bundle, and atomically installs it to
`~/Applications/Hopper Disassembler.app`. REA then opens Hopper so the
operator can choose its demo mode or activate an existing license. Homebrew and
administrator access are not used.

The Hopper launcher action used by REA creates a document from an executable;
its supported command-line interface does not attach to an already-open
document. While another live REA session owns the same target and loader
profile, a second session reports the owning run ID instead of opening a
duplicate document. Closing the owning REA session releases this guard; Hopper
keeps its document open. A later REA session can therefore open another
document for the same target. REA does not currently identify, focus, or reuse
that existing GUI document, and the supported launcher exposes no attach or
reuse action for it.

On supported Linux distributions, approved setup verifies Hopper's official
`.deb`, `.rpm`, or Arch package before invoking the native package manager.
REA runs the supported demo build on a private Xvfb display and selects Hopper's
offered demo mode for each analysis session; it does not require the user's
desktop display. Unattended package-manager access requires
`--yes --install-hopper`. If the host exposes `/tmp/.X11-unix` as an immutable
mount, REA first verifies the conflict and then uses an unprivileged user and
mount namespace with a private mode-1777 tmpfs over that directory only. The
host mount and the rest of `/tmp` remain unchanged; this fallback never invokes
`sudo`. `rea doctor --provider hopper --json` reports the selected
strategy and both host and effective mount facts.

### Hopper in CI

REA's unattended Linux path is validated against Hopper's offered demo mode.
A paid license is not required for that path, and REA does not read, install, or
automate license credentials. Licensed Hopper installations remain supported,
but license activation is an operator-owned prerequisite rather than part of
REA setup.

macOS requires Hopper's first-run UI to be completed in the same user session
that will run REA: choose the demo mode or activate an existing license before
starting an unattended job. Ephemeral macOS runners therefore need a
pre-provisioned user session or a deliberate interactive bootstrap step.

When Hopper cannot start in CI, run
`rea doctor --provider hopper --json` in the failing runner.
Structured failures distinguish private-display dependencies, an unsupported
demo dialog or build, process-ownership conflicts, and an early lifecycle exit.
Apply the reported remediation rather than exposing the runner's desktop,
copying license secrets into logs, or killing unrelated Hopper processes.

## Ghidra

REA connects to an existing Ghidra installation on Linux x64, macOS x64/arm64,
or experimental Windows x64 P0.
It requires Ghidra 12.1.4 and a 64-bit full JDK 21. On macOS, the installation
must include the native decompiler for the host architecture; REA does not
build it or change Gatekeeper quarantine settings.

The adapter exposes 25 read-only operations: thirteen inventory/name/search
operations and twelve function-analysis operations. These cover metadata,
decompilation, assembly, resolved calls, typed references, xrefs, function
dossiers, instructions, recovered data types, measured load mappings, loaded
memory bytes, and observed file offsets. Independent load-image attestation
supports DOS MZ and explicitly selected COM; PE returns its measurements with that limitation.
On Linux and macOS, `annotate_native_function` also edits a function name and/or
entry comments atomically and returns refreshed analysis. These session metadata
edits leave executable bytes unchanged and are discarded on close. GUI controls
require Hopper; Windows P0 remains read-only.

Windows P0 admits native x86-64 PE applications on fixed local NTFS volumes.
The npm package bundles native Job Object ownership, protected private runtime
DACLs, and handle-based path admission; no separate addon installation is needed.
See the [Windows Ghidra P0 guide](windows-ghidra-p0.md) for verified scope and
limitations.

Extract Ghidra and install the JDK outside REA, then export absolute paths:

```bash
export GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=/absolute/path/to/ghidra_12.1.4_PUBLIC
export JAVA_HOME=/absolute/path/to/jdk-21 # optional if java/javac are on PATH
rea doctor --json
rea setup
```

On Windows, configure the existing installation in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR = "C:\tools\ghidra_12.1.4_PUBLIC"
$env:JAVA_HOME = "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21"
rea doctor --json
rea providers --json
```

`rea setup` can configure supported Windows agents and install the bundled
REA skill after approval. Direct registrations use Node to launch REA's entry
script; package-runner registrations use the pinned `npx` command. Hopper
installation remains unavailable on Windows. Setup never installs Ghidra,
Java, or Python. It preserves valid detected Ghidra/JDK settings in agent
registrations. See [Windows Ghidra P0](windows-ghidra-p0.md) for provider diagnostics.

Doctor validates the platform, architecture, application version,
`support/analyzeHeadless` or `support/analyzeHeadless.bat`, Java
version/bitness, and the presence of `javac`/`javac.exe`.
When Java is found through `PATH`, setup records its observed JDK home so GUI
MCP clients do not depend on an incidental shell path. Setup shows every exact
environment entry in its plan, writes only after approval, and never downloads,
installs, upgrades, or modifies Ghidra or Java.

Each verified session uses an ephemeral temporary project and isolated
home/cache/config/temp paths. REA passes `-readOnly`, `-deleteProject`, uses
Ghidra's default analysis and resource settings, and loads its packaged Java
bridge via `-scriptPath`; it never opens an existing user project. Linux and
macOS use a current-user-only local bridge socket and descriptor. The
experimental Windows transport uses authenticated IPv4 loopback with a
private native-owned bearer descriptor and Job Object process ownership.

Operations begin only after default auto-analysis completes. The provider
startup deadline fails the open rather than exposing partial analysis. One
session contains exactly one imported Program; use `provider_id: "ghidra"`, `--provider ghidra`, or
`REA_ANALYSIS_PROVIDER=ghidra` when both Hopper and Ghidra support the target.
One persistent decompiler is owned by the Program, and a serial queue keeps
Ghidra API calls on the owning Program thread without a fixed queue length.
Operations run until a result, caller cancellation, or provider shutdown; there
is no fixed per-operation or response-size ceiling. Unresolved computed calls
remain unknown, reference-kind provenance is preserved, and provider-specific
pseudocode is never treated as original source or Hopper-equivalent text.

Unexpected request failures retain their original internal cause. CLI and MCP
errors expose Error names, messages, and available codes under
`details.diagnostics.failure_cause`; other rejection values retain their
primitive value or an explicit type. Shutdown warnings include the failure
kind, message, and diagnostics, while process and temporary-project cleanup
continues. These messages redact known bridge authentication tokens and
preserve local paths and other analysis context.

Run `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=... npm run verify:ghidra` from a source checkout to
compile and analyze debug and stripped host-native fixtures (ELF on Linux x64
or Mach-O on macOS), plus a native DWARF 4 type-layout object. This lane needs a
host C compiler in addition to Ghidra and its JDK.

Run `GHIDRA_INSTALL_DIR=... npm run verify:ghidra:cross-format` to add AArch64
ELF, x86-64 PE, and x86-64 Mach-O fixture coverage. This separate lane needs
`clang`, LLD, and `lld-link` on `PATH`; `REA_CLANG` and `REA_LLD_LINK` select
alternate command paths. Missing cross-target tooling does not block the
host-native Ghidra acceptance lane.

On a controlled Windows x64 runner, use
`npm run verify:ghidra:windows`. The verifier generates a deterministic native
PE fixture from source bytes and requires the Windows native authority before
opening the provider. This lane remains blocked until those controls are
implemented; its intended checks include operation coverage, digest identity,
and complete runtime cleanup.

## Diagnose, update, and remove

`rea doctor --json` is strictly read-only. `rea update` updates only the npm installation that owns the running CLI. Source checkouts and package-runner copies must be updated through the mechanism that owns them; a fresh package-runner invocation can use `npx rea-agents@latest`. `rea uninstall` removes only REA-owned agent registrations and skill files; `--purge-data` additionally removes REA cache and state paths.

## MCP Registry

REA is published in the official MCP Registry as `io.github.morluto/rea`. Registry
clients can discover the server and install the existing public `rea-agents` npm
package; the Registry entry does not introduce a second distribution artifact.

For a client that supports Registry discovery, search for `io.github.morluto/rea`
and select the npm package. The published metadata launches the existing stdio
server through `npx` with the `mcp` command.

For a client that requires manual configuration, use:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "rea": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "rea-agents@4.1.0", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Persistent registrations should use one exact package version. `rea setup`
writes the same package-runner shape and pins it to the exact version that
performed setup. Run current setup to refresh an older registration, then
restart the client.
